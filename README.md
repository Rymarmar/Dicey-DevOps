# 🎲 Dicey DevOps — Milestone 1 (Playable MVP)

A tiny probability game that demonstrates **risk vs. reward** and teaches **expected value**.  
Frontend (HTML/JS) talks to a Node/Express API. Docker Compose serves both.

Web app deployed via Docker + GitHub Actions

Open source on GitHub (MIT license)

Includes unit tests for roll logic and bankroll calculations

Optionally monitored via Prometheus + Grafana (“deployment success rate” metrics)

## 🚀 Quick Start (Docker)

From the **project root**:

```bash
# Build and start both backend + frontend
docker compose up --build
Then open:

🎮 Frontend: http://localhost:3000

⚙️ Backend health: http://localhost:8080/

🎲 Demo roll: http://localhost:8080/roll

🧩 Gameplay Overview
Start bankroll: $100 (browser-only state)

Bet Types:

Sum (2–12)

Exact Pair (e.g., 1,3)

Any Doubles

Over / Under / Exactly 7

Each result shows:

🎲 Dice and total

✅ Win/Loss and payout

📊 Probability, fair payout, and house edge (5%)

🧪 Local Testing Guide
A) Run through Docker (recommended)
bash
Copy code
docker compose up --build
Then visit:

http://localhost:3000 → Play the game

http://localhost:8080 → Should show “Dicey DevOps backend running”

http://localhost:8080/roll → Example output: {"dice":[x,y],"total":z}

B) Run manually (without Docker)
# 1. Start backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run start

# 2. Open frontend
# Simply open frontend/index.html in your browser

🧹 Docker Cleanup / Rebuild

If you need to reset your environment or start clean:

# Stop and remove all running containers
docker compose down

# Remove old images (optional)
docker rmi dicey_backend nginx:alpine

# Rebuild everything from scratch
docker compose up --build
